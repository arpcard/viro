# ontology-starter-kit

Initialize a GitHub repo for managing your ontology the OBO Library way!

For more details, see this post:
https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/creating-an-ontology-project-an-update/

# Requirements

Any Linux or OS X command line environment should work. You will minimally need the following installed:

 * perl
 * git
 * java8

The kit will also try to make an initial ontology release, unless you tell it not to. It will attempt to download the following dependencies:

 * robot
 * owltools

# Protocol

## Download this starter package

It's recommended you get a release version: https://github.com/cmungall/ontology-starter-kit/releases

## Initialize

First you must be in the root level of the starter kit

    cd ontology-starter-kit

The `seed-my-ontology-repo.pl` command does everything you need. For help:

    ./seed-my-ontology-repo.pl  -h

An example:

    ./seed-my-ontology-repo.pl  -d po ro pato -u cmungall -t "Triffid Behavior ontology" triffo

You should change `cmungall` to either your username, or (preferably) a GitHub org which you have created.

You can list any set of dependencies you like after "-d". However, these must be the official OBO ontology IDs. See http://obofoundry.org for details.

This will create your starter files in
`target/triffid-behavior-ontology`. It will also prepare an initial
release and initialize a local repository (not yet pushed to GitHub).

You can customize at this stage, or (recommended) after making an initial push to github

## Push to GitHub

The starter kit will automatically initialize a git project, add all files and commit.

You will need to create a project on GitHub.

 1. Go to: https://github.com/new
 2. The owner MUST be the org you selected with the `-u` option. The MUST be the one you set with `-t`.
 3. Do not initialize with a README (you already have one)
 4. Click Create
 5. See the section under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"

Follow the instructions there. E.g.

```
cd target/triffid-behavior-ontology
git remote add origin git@github.com:cmungall/triffid-behavior-ontology.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: you can now mv `target/triffid-behavior-ontology` to anywhere you like in your home directory. Or you can do a fresh checkout from github

## OBO Library metadata

The assumption here is that you are ahdering to OBO principles and
want to eventually submit to OBO. Your repo will contain stub metadata
files to help you do this.

You can create pull requests for your ontology on the OBO Foundry. See the `src/metadata` file for more details.

For more documentation, see http://obofoundry.org

## Additional

You will want to also:

 * enable travis
 * enable zenodo (optional)

See the README-editors.md file that has been generated for your project.

## Troubleshooting.

If you have issues, file them here: https://github.com/cmungall/ontology-starter-kit/issues

Some things to check:

 * if something goes wrong you can try again. You may want to remove the `target` dir, or use the `-c` option
 * make sure your ontid has no spaces
 * if your title has spaces, enclose it in quotes


## Customizing

You will likely want to customize the build process, and of course to edit the ontology.

The main thing you will want to do is to modify the seeds that are
used to build the imports. The ones that are there are just examples,
edit them as you like. See the ROBOT docs and the [OBO
Tutorial](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obo-tutorial) for more
info.

## More documentation

You will find additional documentation in the src/ontology/README-editors.md file in your repo
